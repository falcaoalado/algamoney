When have the annotation @RestController, automatically you have the annotations @RequestBody and @Controller

If you have an empty list, has to return code 200 with an empty list

When you create an resource, you have to return the header "Location" of where you can find this resource created,
also it's a good practice to return the resource

Use @RequestBody for an json received from the client, and Spring will bind it to an object
Use @PathVariable for an URI variable
